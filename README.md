# UCD-Big-Data-Programming

- mysql and connection done using python 
- faced problem during json.dumps, then enoded to 'latin-1' 
- tried inserting data to mongodb, successful !!!

- next automating the script

- i can make the primary key of a table as '_id' in mongodb but the problem will arise when there are more than one column as primary key
- making all 'null' value as 0 (even if it is a string)

- using mongoDB compass to get better visualisation of the database
- all the tables have 'id' as primary key, so this can be made '_id'

- the current script failed, it took around 4-5 hours just to loop around 2 tables
- next I will try to run one by one for each table
