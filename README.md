- mysql and connection done using python 
- faced problem during json.dumps, then enoded to 'latin-1' 
- tried inserting data to mongodb, successful !!!

- next automating the script

- i can make the primary key of a table as '_id' in mongodb but the problem will arise when there are more than one column as primary key
- making all 'null' value as 0 (even if it is a string)

- using mongoDB compass to get better visualisation of the database
